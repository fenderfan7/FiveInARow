# FiveInARow
Purpose of this project
This project is purely for learning purposes. It was made to learn about different machine learning techniques with tensorflow and tflearn.

Goal of this project and approach
The goal of this project was to create a Deep-Learning AI for Five in A Row also known as Gomoku. The approach is to simulate random Five In A Row-games and train a classifier, so that it can decide weather a game is lost or won. By that it is meant to learn the goal of the game. When the AI is playing, it classifies every next possible move and choses the one, which looks closest to a win.
There are research Papers, that indicate, AI approaches do not work so well for this game, like this one: http://cs231n.stanford.edu/reports/2016/pdfs/109_Report.pdf
Here you can find a better implementation of Gomoku training and using heuristics for an computer player: http://britlovefan.github.io/AI_Five-in-row/
